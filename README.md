# Kiosker the Grouch

The beginnings of an extension to facilitate using Chrome as a kiosk.

## Dependencies

`npm install` - you know the drill...

## Build

`npm run build` - the `dist/` directory will then contain everything
needed to install the extension

`npm run watch` - the `dist/` directory will be rebuilt when the
code changes and the JS won't be minified for easier debugging
